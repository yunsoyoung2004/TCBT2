// Regression test: S07's Consensus-chair re-weighing prompt
// (consensusAdvantageWeight + consensusDisadvantageWeight, validation.kind
// "consensus_weights") needs TWO numbers that sum to 100 -- but only
// "paired_ratings"-prefixed validation kinds used to render the two-input
// PairedRatingInput; "consensus_weights" fell through to the single-value
// RatingInput, so the UI could only ever submit one number for a two-field
// requirement. extractRuntimeState always rejected that as insufficient,
// so this step could never actually complete in a real session (confirmed
// live in production -- see the fix comment in this file's source).
