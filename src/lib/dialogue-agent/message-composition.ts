/**
 * Patient Authorship Invariant -- channel layer (.claude/TASK_SCOPE.json
 * note2026_09_05, plan file goofy-orbiting-noodle.md Phase 2).
 *
 * The prior line of defense (dialogue-output-validator.ts's
 * assistant_supplied_participant_owned_content check) only ever inspected
 * Claude's own SELF-REPORTED candidateFieldMention -- a free-prose
 * patientFacingMessage that smoothed the participant's wording, invented an
 * assumption, or asserted a conclusion on their behalf passed untouched,
 * because nothing ever re-checked the prose itself against what the
 * participant actually said. This was confirmed live: 32 real turns from
 * stored real-Claude transcripts (artifacts/session-fidelity/live-claude-s07-s08/,
 * live-claude/) violate exactly this, none of them via candidateFieldMention.
 *
 * A denylist of bad phrases cannot close this gap -- the space of ways to
 * phrase an invented conclusion is not enumerable (this was tried first and
 * rejected; see the plan file's "왜 첫 설계는 폐기하는가" section). Instead,
 * for any turn that talks ABOUT a participant-owned field's content, Claude
 * is not permitted to submit free prose at all: it submits a MessagePart[]
 * built only from a fixed set of primitives, and the server -- never
 * Claude -- assembles the final text:
 *
 *   - approved_task: the protocol's own already-approved question (server
 *     substitutes contract.currentTaskText; Claude cannot alter it here).
 *   - quote: must be an exact (normalization-tolerant) substring of
 *     something the PARTICIPANT actually said or already had confirmed --
 *     verified against real transcript data, not trusted from Claude. This
 *     is a decidable predicate (true/false, no false negatives), unlike a
 *     regex "does this look like an invented conclusion" heuristic.
 *   - connector / repair: an id into a small, clinically-reviewed phrase
 *     table (CONNECTOR_TEXT / REPAIR_TEMPLATE_TEXT below) -- Claude picks
 *     from a fixed menu, it does not author the phrase.
 *   - example: illustrative scaffolding for a stalled participant (the
 *     manual's own failure-mode list bans "handing the patient a
 *     pre-formulated answer to ratify", not "helping when they are stuck" --
 *     S07's own step guidance explicitly permits offering numeric anchors).
 *     Always rendered inside a fixed, non-negotiable wrapper phrase so it
 *     reads as illustration, never as fact.
 *
 * Why this closes the S08 Turn 49->50 laundering case (Claude proposed an
 * example belief in one turn, then asserted it as "the belief we confirmed
 * through the trial" the next) without a separate cross-turn ledger: the
 * quote-source haystand below is built ONLY from participant-authored
 * content (their own messages, and confirmedState -- which
 * runtime-context.ts's extractRuntimeState is the sole writer of, and only
 * ever writes verbatim from the participant). Claude's own prior turns --
 * whether they were a quote, a connector, or an example -- are never a
 * valid quote source. An example offered in turn N therefore can never
 * become a "quote" in turn N+1 UNLESS the participant's own subsequent
 * message actually contains it -- at which point it legitimately is their
 * own wording. There is deliberately no exception carved out for "Claude's
 * own recently-approved connector/quote text": the P0-2 lesson already
 * documented in runtime-context.ts (a broader substring match once caused a
 * real regression) argues for the narrowest source set that still works,
 * not the widest one that might.
