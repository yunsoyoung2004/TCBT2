// phrasing routinely separates them into two clauses -- "머리카락 만지는
// 습관이 있는데 그만하고싶어요" ("I have a habit of touching my hair, and I
// want to stop [it]") names "습관" several words before "그만", with no
// object particle immediately adjacent to it at all -- so the lookbehind
// never fired and this was still misclassified as session refusal in the
// actual npx tsx scripts/run-local-session.ts tbct-s02 --interactive
// reproduction. A regex can't reliably resolve every such elliptical
// reference, so the design is now deliberately conservative in the safer
// direction: bare "그만..." (with no session word) only counts as a refusal
// when it is the START of the message (optionally after a short subject/
// filler word) -- i.e. the participant's ENTIRE utterance is essentially
// "I want to stop", with nothing else in the message it could be
// referring to. Any sentence that names a different target BEFORE "그만",
