// lifetime of one test file, and src/lib/api/pilot-study-api.test.ts relies on
// that: its last test sets no actor and exercises the redaction branch left
// behind by the previous one. Tests that want isolation clear storage
// themselves -- see src/lib/db/tbct-source-fidelity-backup.test.ts's own
// beforeEach. Each test file gets a fresh environment, so nothing leaks
